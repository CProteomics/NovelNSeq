# NovelNSeq
Transcriptome-independent precise identification and genomic mapping of novel N-terminal proteoforms generated by alternative splicing

# Overview
NovelNSeq is the first computational tool specifically designed to identify the signature peptides (novel N-terminal extension peptides, NEPs) of novel N-terminal proteins generated by alternative splicing directly from mass spectrometry (MS) data, operating independently of transcriptome data. By fully exploiting peptide encoding rules, it demonstrates significantly higher accuracy than existing tools while enabling comprehensive tracing of peptide encoding mechanisms.
