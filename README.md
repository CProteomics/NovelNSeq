# NovelNSeq
Transcriptome-independent precise identification and genomic mapping of novel N-terminal proteoforms generated by alternative splicing

# Overview
NovelNSeq is the first computational tool specifically designed to identify the signature peptides (novel N-terminal extension peptides, NEPs) of novel N-terminal proteins generated by alternative splicing directly from mass spectrometry (MS) data, operating independently of transcriptome data. By fully exploiting peptide encoding rules, it demonstrates significantly higher accuracy than existing tools while enabling comprehensive tracing of peptide encoding mechanisms.

# System Requirements
.NET Runtime: .NET 6.0 (for C# components). Memory: Minimum 500GB RAM. Operating Systems: Windows 10/11.

# Usage
## 1. Input Preparation
Prepare the following input files:
- **MS/MS spectra**: Place `.mgf` files in `./NovelNSeq/Release/net6.0/Input/`
- **Genome data**:
  - Chromosome FASTA files in `./NovelNSeq/Release/net6.0/chrgff/chr/`
  - Annotation file as `./NovelNSeq/Release/net6.0/chrgff/human_gff.gff`

*Note: Due to file size limitations, the provided genome data files in the repository are incomplete. For actual analysis, please download complete reference files from NCBI.*
## 2. Run NovelNSeq
Execute the program by double-clicking `NovelNSeq.exe`. After completion, results will be generated in: `.\NovelNSeq\Release\net6.0\Output\`

## 3. Output Interpretation
Each line represents a NovelNSeq identification result with the following comma-separated format: MS/MS_spectrum_name, NEP_sequence, PSM_score, genomic_origin.
The genomic_origin field contains detailed mapping information in pipe-delimited format.
